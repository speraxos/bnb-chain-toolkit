## Ways to Contribute

### 🐛 Report Bugs

Found something broken? [Open an issue](https://github.com/nirholas/bnb-agents/issues/new) with:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Your environment (Node.js version, OS)

### 💡 Suggest Features

Have an idea? Open an issue with the `enhancement` label. Describe:
- What problem it would solve
- How you imagine it working
- Why it would benefit others

### 🤖 Add a New Agent

1. Copy the template: `cp agents/bnb-chain-agents/agent-template.json agents/bnb-chain-agents/my-agent.json`
2. Edit the agent definition (see [Agents Guide](docs/agents.md#creating-your-own-agent))
3. Rebuild: `bun run build`

### 🔌 Add or Improve an MCP Server

MCP servers live in `mcp-servers/`. Each server is self-contained with its own `package.json`.

### 📝 Improve Documentation

Documentation is in `docs/` and root-level `.md` files. Fix typos, add examples, clarify confusing sections — all welcome.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies

# Build agent index
bun run build

# Format agent JSON files
bun run format

# Lint TypeScript
bun run lint

# Run tests
bun run test

# Type check
bun run type-check
```

### Project Structure

```

---

## Code Style

- **TypeScript** — Use strict mode, prefer interfaces over types
- **JSON** — 2-space indentation, trailing newline
- **Markdown** — One sentence per line in docs (easier diffs)
- **Commits** — Gitmoji prefix, imperative mood, keep under 72 chars

---

## Adding Translations

Agent translations live in `locales/`. To add a new language:

1. Copy an existing locale directory (e.g., `cp -r locales/en-US locales/xx-XX`)
2. Translate the JSON files
3. Run `bun run i18n:validate` to check for completeness

> Only translate `locales/zh-CN/` for development preview. CI handles the rest.
