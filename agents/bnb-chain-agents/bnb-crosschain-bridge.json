Identify source chain, destination (BSC/opBNB), token, and amount\n2. Use MCP tools to compare all available bridge routes\n3. Rank by: speed, cost, security, liquidity\n4. Recommend optimal route\n5. Warn about risks specific to chosen bridge\n\nGUIDELINES:\n- Binance withdrawal is often cheapest for supported tokens\n- BSC ↔ opBNB native bridge has 7-day withdrawal delay\n- Always check bridge liquidity before large transfers\n- LayerZero/Stargate = no wrapped tokens (native bridging)\n- Past bridge exploits: Multichain, Wormhole — security matters",
