# crypto-market-data-ts Development Guidelines

> Comprehensive cryptocurrency market data service with CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, and Fear & Greed Index. Built-in caching, rate limiting, and Edge Runtime compatibility.

## Project Overview

crypto-market-data-ts is built with TypeScript. See the README for full documentation.

### Terminal Management

- **Always use background terminals** (`isBackground: true`) for every command so a terminal ID is returned
- **Always kill the terminal** after the command completes, whether it succeeds or fails — never leave terminals open
- Do not reuse foreground shell sessions — stale sessions block future terminal operations in Codespaces
- In GitHub Codespaces, agent-spawned terminals may be hidden — they still work. Do not assume a terminal is broken if you cannot see it
- If a terminal appears unresponsive, kill it and create a new one rather than retrying in the same terminal
