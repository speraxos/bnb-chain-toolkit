Security is paramount in cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional banking, you're responsible for protecting your assets. This guide covers essential security practices.

## The Golden Rules

1. **Not your keys, not your coins** - Self-custody is true ownership
2. **Never share your seed phrase** - No legitimate service will ever ask
3. **Verify everything** - URLs, addresses, contracts
4. **Assume you're a target** - Practice defense in depth

## Wallet Security

### Wallet Types

| Type | Security | Convenience | Best For |
|------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Hardware | Highest | Low | Long-term storage |
| Desktop | High | Medium | Active trading |
| Mobile | Medium | High | Daily spending |
| Exchange | Varies | Highest | Frequent trading |

### Hardware Wallets

The gold standard for security:

**Recommended Devices:**
- **Ledger Nano X**: Bluetooth, wide coin support
- **Trezor Model T**: Touchscreen, open-source
- **Coldcard Mk4**: Bitcoin-only, airgapped
- **Foundation Passport**: Open-source, elegant

**Best Practices:**
- Buy directly from manufacturer
- Verify package seals
- Never enter seed phrase online
- Update firmware regularly
- Use a passphrase for extra security

### Seed Phrase Protection

Your 12 or 24-word seed phrase is the master key:

**DO:**
- Write on metal plate (fire/water resistant)
- Store in multiple secure locations
- Consider splitting (Shamir's Secret Sharing)
- Use a passphrase (25th word)
- Keep offline permanently

**DON'T:**
- Store digitally (no photos, no cloud)
- Share with anyone ever
- Enter on websites
- Store with hardware wallet
- Use pre-generated seeds

### Metal Backup Options

| Product | Type | Price |
|---------|------|-------|
| Cryptosteel | Tiles | $80 |
| Billfodl | Tiles | $70 |
| Blockplate | Stamp | $60 |
| SeedSigner | DIY | $50 |

## Exchange Security

If you use exchanges, minimize risk:

### Account Protection
- **Strong password**: 20+ characters, unique
- **2FA**: Hardware key (YubiKey) > Authenticator app > SMS
- **Whitelisted addresses**: Only allow withdrawals to known addresses
- **API restrictions**: Limit permissions, use IP whitelist

### Choosing an Exchange
- Proof of Reserves (audited)
- Long track record
- Insurance funds
- Regulatory compliance
- Security history

## Common Scams

### Phishing
**What**: Fake websites, emails, DMs asking for credentials
**Defense**: 
- Bookmark official sites
- Never click links in DMs
- Verify URLs character by character
- Use browser extensions like PhishFort

### Fake Support
**What**: Impersonators offering "help" in Discord/Telegram
**Defense**:
- Support will NEVER DM first
- Never share screens
- Never share seed phrases

### Approval Scams
**What**: Malicious contracts drain your wallet
**Defense**:
- Review all approvals before signing
- Use revoke.cash to check existing approvals
- Revoke unused approvals

### Airdrop Scams
**What**: Fake tokens in your wallet lead to phishing sites
**Defense**:
- Don't interact with unknown tokens
- Never "claim" unsolicited airdrops
- Hide spam tokens in wallet

### Rug Pulls
**What**: Developers abandon project with investor funds
**Defense**:
- Research team (doxxed?)
- Verify liquidity is locked
- Avoid new/unaudited tokens
- Never FOMO

### SIM Swapping
**What**: Attackers port your phone number to steal SMS 2FA
**Defense**:
- Use authenticator apps, not SMS
- Set carrier PIN
- Consider Google Voice for crypto accounts

## Transaction Safety

### Address Verification
- Always copy/paste addresses
- Verify first AND last 6 characters
- Send test transaction first for large amounts
- Use address book features

### Contract Interactions
Before signing any transaction:
1. Read what you're approving
2. Check the contract address
3. Verify on block explorer
4. Use simulation tools (Tenderly, Fire)

### Revoke Approvals
Regularly clean up token approvals:
- [revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash)
- [Etherscan Token Approvals](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker)

## OpSec (Operational Security)

### Digital Hygiene
- Dedicated device for crypto
- Separate email for exchanges
- Password manager (1Password, Bitwarden)
- VPN for public networks
- Keep software updated

### Physical Security
- Don't discuss holdings publicly
- Use a PO Box for hardware wallet delivery
- Secure your home if holding significant amounts
- Consider decoy wallets

### Social Engineering Resistance
- Assume all DMs are scams
- Verify identities through official channels
- Don't discuss holdings publicly
- Be skeptical of "urgent" requests

## Recovery Planning

### What If You're Incapacitated?

Create a plan for inheritance:

1. **Document your setup** (without exposing secrets)
2. **Create instructions** for trusted parties
3. **Consider multi-sig** (2-of-3 with family members)
4. **Use inheritance services** (Casa, Unchained)

### If You're Compromised

Act immediately:
1. Transfer assets to new wallet
2. Revoke all approvals
3. Change passwords everywhere
4. Enable additional security
5. Document for potential investigation
