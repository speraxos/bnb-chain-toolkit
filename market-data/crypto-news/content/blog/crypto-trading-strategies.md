## Essential Trading Strategies

### 1. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

**The Strategy:**
Invest a fixed amount at regular intervals.

**Example:**
- $100/week into Bitcoin
- Regardless of price
- Over 1+ year

**Pros:**
- Removes emotional decisions
- Reduces timing risk
- Simple to execute
- Works in any market

**Cons:**
- May underperform in strong trends
- Requires patience

### 2. Trend Following

**The Strategy:**
Trade in the direction of the prevailing trend.

**Identification:**
- Higher highs, higher lows = uptrend
- Lower highs, lower lows = downtrend

**Rules:**
- Only long in uptrends
- Only short in downtrends
- Use moving averages for confirmation

**Example Setup:**
- Price above 50-day MA = bullish
- Price below 50-day MA = bearish

### 3. Support and Resistance

**The Strategy:**
Trade bounces off key price levels.

**Support**: Price level where buying emerges
**Resistance**: Price level where selling emerges

**Trading Rules:**
- Buy near support with stop below
- Sell near resistance with stop above
- Breakouts signal trend continuation

### 4. Range Trading

**The Strategy:**
Trade between support and resistance in sideways markets.

**Setup:**
- Identify clear range
- Buy at bottom of range
- Sell at top of range
- Use tight stops

**Best for:** Low-volatility periods

### 5. Breakout Trading

**The Strategy:**
Enter when price breaks through significant levels.

**Identification:**
- Consolidation patterns (triangles, rectangles)
- Key support/resistance breaks
- Volume confirmation

**Rules:**
- Wait for decisive break (not just wick)
- Volume should increase on breakout
- Set stops below breakout point

## Technical Analysis Basics

### Price Charts

**Chart Types:**
- **Candlesticks**: Most informative
- **Line charts**: Simple trend view
- **Bar charts**: Similar to candles

**Candlestick Anatomy:**
```
    │ <- Upper wick (high)
    ┌┴┐
    │ │ <- Body (open to close)
    └┬┘
    │ <- Lower wick (low)
```

Green candle: Close > Open
Red candle: Close < Open

### Key Indicators

#### Moving Averages
- **SMA (Simple)**: Average of closing prices
- **EMA (Exponential)**: Weights recent prices more

**Common Settings:**
- 20-day: Short-term trend
- 50-day: Medium-term trend
- 200-day: Long-term trend

**Signals:**
- Price above MA = bullish
- MA crossovers = trend changes

#### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- Measures momentum
- Scale: 0-100
- Overbought: >70
- Oversold: <30

**Usage:**
- Look for divergences
- Confirm trend strength
- Identify reversal zones

#### MACD
- Trend and momentum indicator
- Signal line crossovers
- Histogram shows momentum

#### Volume
- Confirms price moves
- High volume = conviction
- Low volume = weak moves

### Chart Patterns

**Bullish Patterns:**
- Double bottom (W shape)
- Inverse head and shoulders
- Bull flag
- Ascending triangle

**Bearish Patterns:**
- Double top (M shape)
- Head and shoulders
- Bear flag
- Descending triangle

## Risk Management

The most important aspect of trading.

### Position Sizing

**The 1-2% Rule:**
Never risk more than 1-2% of portfolio on a single trade.

**Calculation:**
```
Position size = (Account × Risk %) / (Entry - Stop Loss)

Example:
Account: $10,000
Risk: 2% = $200
Entry: $50,000 BTC
Stop: $48,000 (4% below)

Position = $200 / $2,000 = 0.1 BTC ($5,000)
```

### Stop Losses

Always use stop losses:

**Types:**
- **Fixed**: Set at specific price
- **Trailing**: Follows price up, locks in profit
- **Mental**: Dangerous, requires discipline

**Placement:**
- Below support (for longs)
- Above resistance (for shorts)
- Account for volatility (not too tight)

### Risk/Reward Ratio

Aim for at least 1:2 risk/reward:

| Risk | Reward | Win Rate Needed |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | 1 | 50%+ |
| 1 | 2 | 33%+ |
| 1 | 3 | 25%+ |

**Example:**
- Risk: $100
- Target: $200
- R:R = 1:2
- Only need 33% win rate to profit

### Portfolio Allocation

**Conservative:**
- 70-80% BTC/ETH
- 20-30% stablecoins/cash
- 0% leverage

**Moderate:**
- 50-60% BTC/ETH
- 20-30% top 20 altcoins
- 10-20% stablecoins

**Aggressive:**
- 30-40% BTC/ETH
- 40-50% altcoins
- 10-20% small caps
- Consider leverage (high risk)

## Trading Psychology

### Common Mistakes

**FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**
- Buying after big moves
- Entering without analysis
- Solution: Stick to your plan

**Revenge Trading**
- Trading to recover losses
- Emotional decisions
- Solution: Take breaks after losses

**Overtrading**
- Too many positions
- Trading when there's no setup

### Healthy Trading Habits

2. **Journal trades** - Review and learn
