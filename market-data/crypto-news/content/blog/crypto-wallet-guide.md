Your cryptocurrency wallet is your gateway to the blockchain. Understanding wallet types and security is essential for protecting your assets.

## What is a Crypto Wallet?

A crypto wallet doesn't store cryptocurrency - it stores the private keys that prove ownership. The actual crypto exists on the blockchain.

### Key Components

**Private Key:**
- Secret code that controls your funds
- Never share with anyone
- Lose it = lose access forever

**Public Key/Address:**
- Like your bank account number
- Safe to share for receiving funds
- Derived from private key

**Seed Phrase (Recovery Phrase):**
- 12-24 words that generate your private keys
- Master backup for all accounts
- Store offline, never digitally

## Hot Wallets vs Cold Wallets

**Cons:**

7. **Optional: Add passphrase** (25th word)

### Software Wallet Setup

2. **Create new wallet**
3. **Write down seed phrase** immediately
4. **Verify by re-entering** seed phrase
5. **Set password** for app access
6. **Enable security features** (biometrics, etc.)

## Seed Phrase Security

### Storage Best Practices

**DO:**

- Consider bank safe deposit box
- Split across locations (2-of-3)

- Email to yourself
- Use a pre-generated seed

| Billfodl | Letter tiles | $70 |
| Blockplate | Center punch | $60 |

## Multi-Sig Wallets

Require multiple keys to authorize transactions.

### How They Work

- 3-of-5: Any 3 of 5 keys needed
- Prevents single point of failure

- **Sparrow**: Bitcoin-focused
- **Casa**: Managed service

- Social recovery options
- Gasless transactions
- Custom security rules

### Examples

- Sequence
- Soul Wallet

## Common Wallet Mistakes

1. **Storing seed phrase digitally** - Screenshots, notes apps, cloud
2. **Not testing recovery** - Verify you can restore before depositing
3. **Single backup location** - Fire/theft loses everything
4. **Approving blindly** - Read transaction details
5. **Using public WiFi** - Especially for hardware wallets
6. **Reusing seed phrases** - Each wallet should be unique

## Wallet Organization

### Recommended Setup

**Cold Storage (Hardware Wallet)**
- Main holdings
- Long-term investments
- Rarely accessed

**Hot Wallet (MetaMask, etc.)**
- Active DeFi/trading
- Smaller amounts
- Revoke approvals regularly

**Burner Wallet**
- NFT mints
- Untested protocols
- Minimum funds only

## Conclusion

Your wallet choice depends on your needs, holdings, and risk tolerance. Hardware wallets provide the best security for significant holdings, while hot wallets offer convenience for daily use. Many users benefit from using both.
