Decentralized Finance (DeFi) recreates traditional financial services using blockchain technology. This guide explains how DeFi works and how to get started.

## What is DeFi?

DeFi refers to financial services built on public blockchains:

- **No intermediaries**: Trade, lend, and borrow without banks
- **Permissionless**: Anyone with a wallet can participate
- **Transparent**: All transactions are on-chain
- **Composable**: Protocols can interact ("money legos")

### DeFi vs Traditional Finance

| Aspect | Traditional Finance | DeFi |
|--------|---------------------|------|
| Access | KYC required | Wallet only |
| Hours | Business hours | 24/7/365 |
| Custody | Third party | Self-custody |
| Transparency | Opaque | Fully transparent |
| Speed | Days | Minutes |
| Interest | 0.5% savings | 2-10%+ |

## Core DeFi Primitives

### 1. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

Trade tokens without a centralized exchange:

**Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**
- Use liquidity pools instead of order books
- Price determined by mathematical formula
- Anyone can provide liquidity

**Top DEXs (2026)**
| DEX | Chain | Daily Volume |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| Uniswap | Ethereum, L2s | $2B+ |
| Curve | Multi-chain | $500M+ |
| dYdX | Cosmos | $1B+ |
| Jupiter | Solana | $500M+ |

### 2. Lending & Borrowing

Earn interest or borrow against your crypto:

**How it works:**
1. Deposit assets to earn yield
2. Borrow against collateral (overcollateralized)
3. Pay variable interest rates
4. Liquidation if collateral ratio drops

**Top Lending Protocols**
- **Aave**: Multi-chain, flash loans
- **Compound**: Ethereum-focused
- **MakerDAO**: DAI stablecoin minting

### 3. Stablecoins

Cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat:

| Type | Examples | Mechanism |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Fiat-backed | USDC, USDT | Bank reserves |
| Crypto-backed | DAI, LUSD | Overcollateralized |
| Algorithmic | FRAX | Partial backing + algo |

### 4. Liquid Staking

Stake and maintain liquidity:

- **Lido (stETH)**: Largest, ~$15B TVL
- **Rocket Pool (rETH)**: Decentralized
- **Coinbase (cbETH)**: Centralized but easy

Earn staking rewards while using tokens in DeFi.

### 5. Derivatives

On-chain futures, options, and perps:

- **dYdX**: Perpetual futures
- **GMX**: Decentralized perpetuals
- **Synthetix**: Synthetic assets
- **Lyra**: Options trading

## Yield Farming

Earn rewards by providing capital to protocols.

### Types of Yield

1. **Trading Fees**: Share of swap fees in LP
2. **Interest**: Lending rates
3. **Token Rewards**: Protocol incentives
4. **Staking**: Proof of Stake rewards

### Yield Farming Strategy

```
Step 1: Research protocol safety
Step 2: Deposit assets
Step 3: Receive LP tokens or receipt tokens
Step 4: Optional: Stake LP tokens for extra rewards
Step 5: Harvest and compound
```

### Risk vs Reward

| Risk Level | APY Range | Examples |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Low | 2-5% | ETH staking, USDC lending |
| Medium | 5-15% | Stablecoin LPs, blue-chip LPs |
| High | 15-50%+ | New pools, leveraged farming |

## Liquidity Pools Explained

LPs are the backbone of DEXs:

### How Pools Work
1. LPs deposit two tokens (e.g., ETH + USDC)
2. Pool uses constant product formula: x * y = k
3. Traders swap against the pool
4. LPs earn fees proportional to share

### Impermanent Loss

The main risk for LPs:

- Occurs when token prices diverge
- "Impermanent" because it reverses if prices return
- Can exceed earned fees in volatile pairs

**Example:**
- Deposit: 1 ETH ($2,000) + 2,000 USDC
- ETH doubles to $4,000
- Pool rebalances to: 0.707 ETH + 2,828 USDC
- Value: $5,656 vs. holding: $6,000
- IL: ~5.7%

**Mitigation:**
- Farm stablecoin pairs (no IL)
- Use concentrated liquidity
- Choose correlated pairs
- Factor IL into yield calculations

## Getting Started with DeFi

### Prerequisites
- Self-custody wallet (MetaMask, Rabby)
- ETH for gas (or chain's native token)
- Understanding of basic concepts

### Step-by-Step: Your First Swap

1. **Connect wallet** to Uniswap
2. **Select tokens**: ETH → USDC
3. **Enter amount**
4. **Review** price impact and fees
5. **Approve** token (one-time)
6. **Swap** and confirm transaction

### Step-by-Step: Your First LP

1. **Choose pool**: ETH-USDC on Uniswap
2. **Add liquidity**: Equal value of both tokens
3. **Receive LP tokens**
4. **Optional**: Stake on reward platform
5. **Monitor** position and harvest rewards

## DeFi Security

### Protocol Risks
- Smart contract bugs
- Oracle manipulation
- Admin key risks
- Economic exploits

### Personal Security
- Never share seed phrases
- Verify contract addresses
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- Revoke unused approvals
- Start with small amounts

### Due Diligence Checklist
- [ ] Audited by reputable firms?
- [ ] Open-source code?
- [ ] Time-tested (Lindy)?
- [ ] Team doxxed?
- [ ] TVL and volume sustainable?
- [ ] Tokenomics sensible?

## Top DeFi Protocols (2026)

### By TVL
1. Lido - $15B+ (Liquid staking)
2. Aave - $10B+ (Lending)
3. MakerDAO - $8B+ (Stablecoin)
4. Uniswap - $5B+ (DEX)
5. Curve - $3B+ (Stablecoin DEX)

### Emerging Trends
- **Restaking**: EigenLayer, Babylon
- **Intent-based DEXs**: Cowswap, UniswapX
- **Real World Assets (RWA)**: Tokenized treasuries
- **Account Abstraction**: Better UX, gas sponsorship

## DeFi on Layer 2

Lower fees make DeFi accessible:

| Chain | Avg. Swap Fee | Top Protocol |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Arbitrum | $0.10-0.50 | GMX |
| Optimism | $0.10-0.50 | Velodrome |
| Base | $0.05-0.20 | Aerodrome |
| zkSync | $0.10-0.30 | SyncSwap |

## Conclusion

DeFi offers unprecedented access to financial services. While opportunities are significant, so are the risks. Start small, learn continuously, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.
