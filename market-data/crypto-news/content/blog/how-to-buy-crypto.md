Ready to buy your first cryptocurrency? This guide walks you through the entire process, from choosing an exchange to securing your assets.

## Before You Begin

### Prerequisites
- Government-issued ID (for verification)
- Bank account or credit/debit card
- Email address and phone number
- Basic understanding of cryptocurrency

### How Much to Invest?

**The golden rule**: Only invest what you can afford to lose.

Cryptocurrency is volatile. Prices can drop 50% or more. Consider:
- Your financial situation
- Emergency fund (3-6 months expenses)
- Existing retirement savings
- Risk tolerance

A common starting point: 1-5% of your investment portfolio.

## Step 1: Choose an Exchange

### Recommended Exchanges

| Exchange | Best For | Fees | Beginners |
|----------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Coinbase** | Ease of use | 0.5-1.5% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Kraken** | Security | 0.16-0.26% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Gemini** | Regulation | 0.25-0.35% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Binance** | Low fees | 0.1% | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Robinhood** | No fees | 0% (spread) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

### What to Look For
- **Regulation**: Licensed in your jurisdiction
- **Security**: Insurance, 2FA, cold storage
- **Reputation**: Years in operation, no major hacks
- **Fees**: Trading fees, deposit/withdrawal costs
- **Coin selection**: Supports the assets you want
- **Payment methods**: Bank, card, Apple Pay, etc.

## Step 2: Create an Account

### Registration Process

1. **Visit the exchange website** (verify URL carefully!)
2. **Enter email and create password** (use a unique, strong password)
3. **Verify email** via confirmation link
4. **Enable 2FA** immediately using an authenticator app

### Identity Verification (KYC)

Most regulated exchanges require:

**Basic Verification:**
- Full legal name
- Date of birth
- Address
- Phone number

**Enhanced Verification:**
- Government ID (passport, driver's license)
- Selfie with ID
- Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement)

**Verification timeline**: Minutes to 48 hours depending on exchange.

## Step 3: Add a Payment Method

### Payment Options

| Method | Speed | Fees | Limits |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| Bank transfer (ACH) | 3-5 days | Free | High |
| Wire transfer | 1-2 days | $10-30 | Very high |
| Debit card | Instant | 2-4% | Medium |
| Credit card | Instant | 3-5% | Medium |
| Apple/Google Pay | Instant | 2-4% | Medium |

### Recommendations
- **For beginners**: Start with debit card (instant)
- **For regular investors**: Use bank transfer (lowest fees)
- **For large amounts**: Wire transfer (highest limits)

**Note**: Credit cards often treat crypto purchases as cash advances, incurring additional fees and interest.

## Step 4: Buy Cryptocurrency

### Placing Your First Order

1. **Navigate to Buy/Sell** or Trade section
2. **Select cryptocurrency** (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)
3. **Enter amount** in USD or crypto units
4. **Review the order** - check fees and total
5. **Confirm purchase**

### Order Types

**Simple Buy:**
- Enter amount, get current market price
- Best for beginners
- Higher fees

**Advanced Trading:**
- Market order: Buy immediately at current price
- Limit order: Buy when price reaches your target
- Lower fees

### Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

Instead of one large purchase:
- Set up recurring buys (weekly, monthly)
- Removes emotion and timing pressure
- Smooths out volatility
- Available on most exchanges

**Example**: $100/week into Bitcoin builds position over time without worrying about market timing.

## Step 5: Secure Your Crypto

### On-Exchange Storage (Temporary)

Exchanges provide wallets for your crypto:

**Pros:**
- Convenient for trading
- Easy to use
- Recovery options

**Cons:**
- Exchange controls your keys
- Vulnerable to hacks
- Could restrict access

### Self-Custody (Recommended for Long-term)

For holdings you want to keep:

1. **Get a wallet** (hardware or software)
2. **Write down seed phrase** securely
3. **Withdraw from exchange** to your wallet address
4. **Verify receipt** on block explorer

**Recommendation**: Hardware wallet for >$1,000 in holdings.

## Fee Comparison

### Buying $1,000 of Bitcoin

| Exchange | Method | Fees | You Receive |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| Coinbase | Debit card | ~$39 | ~$961 |
| Coinbase Pro | Bank transfer | ~$5 | ~$995 |
| Kraken | Bank transfer | ~$2.60 | ~$997 |
| Binance | Bank transfer | ~$1 | ~$999 |

**Tip**: Use pro/advanced interfaces for lower fees.

## What to Buy?

### For Beginners

**Bitcoin (BTC)**
- Original cryptocurrency
- Most decentralized and secure
- Store of value / "digital gold"

**Ethereum (ETH)**

### Portfolio Approaches

**Conservative:** 70% BTC, 30% ETH

### What to Avoid
