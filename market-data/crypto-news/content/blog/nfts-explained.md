NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) represent unique digital ownership on the blockchain. Beyond the 2021 hype, NFTs have evolved into practical applications. This guide covers how NFTs work and their real use cases.

## What Are NFTs?

**Non-fungible** means unique and not interchangeable:
- **Fungible**: 1 BTC = 1 BTC (identical)
- **Non-fungible**: Each NFT is unique

NFTs are tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership of a specific item:
- Digital art and collectibles
- In-game items
- Music and media
- Real-world assets
- Identity and credentials

## How NFTs Work

### The Technology

NFTs are smart contracts following standards:

**ERC-721**: Original NFT standard
- Each token has unique ID
- Tracks individual ownership
- Supports metadata (name, image, etc.)

**ERC-1155**: Multi-token standard
- Can be fungible or non-fungible
- More gas efficient
- Used in gaming

### Metadata

NFT metadata describes the token:
```json
{
  "name": "Cool Cat #1234",
  "description": "A unique cool cat",
  "image": "ipfs://Qm.../1234.png",
  "attributes": [
    {"trait_type": "Background", "value": "Blue"},
    {"trait_type": "Fur", "value": "Orange"}
  ]
}
```

**Storage:**
- On-chain (expensive, permanent)
- IPFS (decentralized)
- Arweave (permanent)
- Centralized servers (risky)

## NFT Use Cases

### 1. Digital Art

The original use case:
- Artists sell work directly
- Royalties on secondary sales
- Provable authenticity
- Global marketplace

**Evolution in 2026:**
- Generative art remains strong
- AI-assisted creation
- Physical + digital pairings
- Museum exhibitions

### 2. Profile Pictures (PFPs)

Community and identity:
- Social signaling
- Community membership
- Brand building

**Notable Collections:**
| Collection | Floor | Holders |
|------------|-------|---------|
| CryptoPunks | ~$100K | 3,000+ |
| Bored Apes | ~$50K | 5,000+ |
| Pudgy Penguins | ~$30K | 4,000+ |

### 3. Gaming

True ownership of in-game assets:
- Items tradeable between players
- Cross-game compatibility (potential)
- Play-to-earn mechanics

**Examples:**
- Axie Infinity (creatures)
- Gods Unchained (cards)
- Loot (generative RPG items)
- Parallel (card game)

### 4. Music and Media

Artists monetizing directly:
- Limited edition releases
- Concert tickets
- Fan experiences
- Streaming royalties

**Platforms:**
- Sound.xyz
- Catalog
- Audius

### 5. Real-World Assets (RWA)

Tokenizing physical items:
- Real estate fractions
- Luxury goods authentication
- Supply chain tracking
- Tickets and memberships

### 6. Identity and Credentials

Verifiable credentials:
- Academic degrees
- Professional certifications
- Event attendance (POAPs)
- Membership tokens

### 7. Domain Names

Decentralized naming:
- **ENS** (.eth domains)
- **Unstoppable Domains** (.crypto, .nft)
- Human-readable addresses
- Decentralized websites

## NFT Marketplaces

### Major Platforms

| Marketplace | Chain | Focus | Fees |
|-------------|-------|-------|------|
| OpenSea | Multi-chain | General | 2.5% |
| Blur | Ethereum | Trading | 0% |
| Magic Eden | Multi-chain | General | 2% |
| Foundation | Ethereum | Art | 5% |
| SuperRare | Ethereum | Fine art | 3% |

### Marketplace Trends (2026)
- Zero-fee trading (Blur model)
- Creator royalties enforcement
- Multi-chain support
- Aggregation (Reservoir)

## How to Buy NFTs

### Step-by-Step

1. **Set up a wallet** (MetaMask, Phantom)
2. **Add funds** (ETH for Ethereum, SOL for Solana)
3. **Connect to marketplace** (OpenSea, etc.)
4. **Browse collections**
5. **Make offer or buy now**
6. **Confirm transaction**
7. **NFT appears in wallet**

### Due Diligence

Before buying:
- [ ] Verify contract address
- [ ] Check creator authenticity
- [ ] Review trading history
- [ ] Assess community strength
- [ ] Understand utility
- [ ] Consider liquidity

## Creating NFTs

### Minting Process

1. **Create your content** (art, music, etc.)
2. **Choose platform** (OpenSea, Zora, etc.)
3. **Connect wallet**
4. **Upload files and metadata**
5. **Set price/auction type**
6. **Pay gas fee to mint**
7. **NFT is now on-chain**

### Considerations

**Royalties:**
- Set secondary sale royalty (2.5-10%)
- Not all marketplaces enforce

**Storage:**
- Use IPFS or Arweave
- Avoid centralized hosting

**Editions:**
- 1/1 (unique)
- Limited edition (100, 1000)
- Open edition (unlimited time-limited)

## NFT Economics

### Floor Price
- Lowest listed price in collection
- Key health indicator
- Can vary dramatically

### Traits and Rarity
- Rare traits command premiums
- Rarity tools rank items
- Community determines value

### Liquidity Considerations
- NFTs are illiquid
- May not sell quickly
- Bid-ask spreads can be wide

## Risks and Considerations

### Market Risks
- **Volatility**: 90%+ drops common
- **Liquidity**: May not find buyer
- **Hype cycles**: Value tied to attention

### Technical Risks
- **Smart contract bugs**
- **Metadata storage failure**
- **Platform dependency**

### Legal Risks
- **Copyright**: Owning NFT ≠ owning copyright
- **Regulation**: Evolving laws
- **Taxes**: Capital gains apply

### Common Scams
- Fake collections
- Phishing links
- Wallet drainers
- Rug pulls

## NFT Best Practices

### For Collectors
1. Start with what you genuinely like
2. Research before buying
3. Diversify holdings
4. Don't spend more than you can lose
5. Verify everything

### For Creators
1. Build community first
2. Provide utility beyond art
3. Be transparent about roadmap
4. Honor royalty expectations
5. Use proper storage

## The State of NFTs in 2026

### What Survived
- Quality art collections

## Conclusion

NFTs represent a fundamental innovation in digital ownership. While the speculative mania has cooled, the technology continues to find real applications in art, gaming, identity, and more. Focus on genuine interest and utility rather than speculation.
