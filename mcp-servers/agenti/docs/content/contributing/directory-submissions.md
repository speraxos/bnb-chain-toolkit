## Hacker News Submission

**Title:** Show HN: Universal Crypto MCP – 330+ blockchain tools for AI agents

**URL:** https://github.com/nirholas/universal-crypto-mcp

**Text (for self-post if needed):**
```
I built an MCP server that connects AI assistants like Claude to blockchain networks.

Problem: Managing crypto across 15+ chains is tedious. Different explorers, different dApps, constant context switching.

Solution: Natural language blockchain interaction. Ask Claude "What's my portfolio across all chains?" or "Swap 1 ETH to USDC on Arbitrum" and it just works.

Features:
- 330+ tools for DeFi, trading, security
- 15+ chains: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Solana, etc.
- Security scanning for tokens/contracts
- Open source (Apache 2.0)

Tech stack: TypeScript, MCP SDK, viem

Would love feedback on the architecture or feature ideas.
```
