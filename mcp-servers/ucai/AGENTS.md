# UCAI Development Guidelines

> Universal Contract AI Interface (UCAI) 🔗 ABI to MCP | The open standard for connecting AI agents to blockchain. MCP server generator for smart contracts. Claude + Uniswap, Aave, ERC20, NFTs, DeFi. Python CLI, Web3 integration, transaction simulation. Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum EVM chains. Claude, GPT, LLM tooling, Solidity, OpenAI.

## Project Overview

UCAI is built with Python. See the README for full documentation.

### Terminal Management

- **Always use background terminals** (`isBackground: true`) for every command so a terminal ID is returned
- **Always kill the terminal** after the command completes, whether it succeeds or fails — never leave terminals open
- Do not reuse foreground shell sessions — stale sessions block future terminal operations in Codespaces
- In GitHub Codespaces, agent-spawned terminals may be hidden — they still work. Do not assume a terminal is broken if you cannot see it
- If a terminal appears unresponsive, kill it and create a new one rather than retrying in the same terminal
