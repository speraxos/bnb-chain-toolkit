# UCAI — AI-Powered Smart Contract Tools

> Turn any smart contract into Claude tools. The easiest way to build MCP servers from Ethereum ABIs.

## What is UCAI?

UCAI (Universal Chain AI) connects AI assistants like Claude to blockchain smart contracts through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Paste a contract address, get a working MCP server.

- Documentation: https://docs.ucai.tech
- GitHub: https://github.com/nirholas/UCAI
- NPM Package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ucai

## Core Features

### MCP Server Builder
Generate complete TypeScript MCP servers from any verified smart contract:
- Paste contract address → Get working MCP server
- Supports Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, BSC
- Auto-detects proxy contracts and fetches implementation ABIs
- Creates typed tool definitions for Claude Desktop

### Security Scanner
AI-powered smart contract risk analysis:
- 50+ security patterns detected
- Risk score 0-100 (higher = safer)
- Detects rug pulls, honeypots, hidden mints, pause functions
- Identifies positive indicators (renounced ownership, locked liquidity)

### Contract Whisperer
Plain English explanations of smart contracts:
- What does this contract do?
- Who has special permissions?
- What are the tokenomics?
- What are the risks?

### Pro Templates
Production-ready MCP server templates:
- DeFi Bundle (Uniswap, Aave, Compound)
- NFT Bundle (OpenSea, Blur, Reservoir)
- Governance Bundle (Snapshot, Governor Bravo)
- Analytics Bundle (Dune, The Graph, Chainlink)

## For AI Developers

### Install via NPM
```bash
npm install -g ucai
ucai generate 0xContractAddress --chain ethereum
```

### Use the API
```bash
curl https://mcp.ucai.tech/api/analyze \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address": "0x...", "chainId": 1}'
```

### Claude Desktop Integration
Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-contract": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "path/to/generated-server.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```
