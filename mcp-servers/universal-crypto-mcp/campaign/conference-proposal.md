## Talk Abstract (Short - 100 words)

**AI Economics: When Agents Have Wallets**

What happens when AI agents can pay for things? This talk introduces x402—an implementation of HTTP 402 that enables AI agents to make autonomous payments. We'll cover the architecture of economic AI agents, demonstrate live transactions, explore the emerging AI-to-AI marketplace, and discuss the safety considerations of giving AI financial agency. You'll leave with working code and a vision for how AI economics will reshape the internet.

## Talk Abstract (Long - 250 words)

**AI Economics: When Agents Have Wallets**

HTTP 402 "Payment Required" has been reserved since 1999, waiting for internet-native payments. AI agents have finally given us a reason to use it.

In this talk, I'll introduce x402—a protocol that enables AI agents to make autonomous payments. Unlike human users who can navigate paywalls, enter credit cards, and manage subscriptions, AI agents have been fundamentally limited by their inability to transact. x402 changes this by providing a simple, secure way for AI to pay for services on demand.

**What we'll cover:**

1. **The Problem**: Why AI agents need economic agency and why traditional payment rails don't work
2. **The Protocol**: How x402 implements HTTP 402 for programmatic clients (5 lines of code)
3. **Live Demo**: Watch Claude pay for a premium API in real-time
4. **The Architecture**: Building MCP servers with payment capabilities
5. **AI Marketplaces**: How agents are already trading services with each other
6. **Safety & Guardrails**: Spending limits, whitelisting, and responsible AI economics
7. **The Future**: Implications for AI-to-AI commerce, agent specialization, and economic coordination

**Technical depth**: Intermediate. Familiarity with APIs helpful but not required.

**Takeaways**: 
- Working x402 implementation you can deploy today
- Understanding of AI economic agent architecture
- Framework for thinking about AI financial safety
- Glimpse into the future of AI-to-AI commerce

The code is open source. The implications are profound. Let's explore both.

## Speaker Bio (Short)

Nich (@nichxbt) is the creator of Universal Crypto MCP, an open-source platform with 380+ tools that connects AI agents to blockchain networks. He's focused on building infrastructure for AI economic agents, including the x402 payment protocol. His work is used by developers building AI applications across DeFi, trading, and autonomous agent systems.

## Speaker Bio (Long)

Nich is a developer and builder working at the intersection of AI and crypto infrastructure. He created Universal Crypto MCP—an open-source MCP server that provides 380+ blockchain tools for AI agents across 20+ networks including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Solana, and more.

His current focus is x402, a protocol implementing HTTP 402 payments for AI agents. This enables AI to autonomously pay for premium APIs, trade services with other agents, and participate in economic activity without human intervention.

Before diving into AI infrastructure, Nich spent years in DeFi protocol development and has shipped code handling significant transaction volume. He's a strong advocate for open-source development and believes infrastructure should be public goods.

Nich writes about AI agents, crypto infrastructure, and the future of autonomous systems. You can find him [@nichxbt](https://x.com/nichxbt) or on GitHub at [github.com/nirholas](https://github.com/nirholas).

## Detailed Talk Outline (30 minutes)

### 1. Opening Hook (2 min)

```
[Show Claude Desktop on screen]

"Last month, I watched Claude buy something for the first time.

Not a simulated purchase. A real transaction. $0.05 for weather data.

It asked me permission, signed the payment, and returned premium satellite
forecasts—all in about 2 seconds.

That moment changed how I think about AI agents."
```

### 2. The Problem: Broke AI (4 min)

**Slide: "AI Agents Are Broke"**

- AI can write $10,000 worth of code
- AI can analyze data that saves hundreds of hours
- AI can navigate complex research
- AI CANNOT buy a $0.05 API call

**Slide: "The Current Workflow"**

1. Human signs up for service
2. Human enters payment info
3. Human gets API key
4. Human configures AI
5. Repeat for every service

"This is the limitation shaping how we build AI systems today."

### 3. HTTP 402: The Sleeping Giant (3 min)

**Slide: "A 25-Year-Old Idea"**

- RFC 2068 (1997): HTTP 402 reserved for future use
- W3C always intended web to have native payments
- Nobody used it because no standard payment method

**Slide: "x402 Wakes It Up"**

```http
GET /api/premium-data HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
{
  "amount": "0.05",
  "currency": "USD", 
  "address": "0x...",
  "network": "arbitrum"
}
```

"Simple enough for an AI to understand and act on."

### 4. Live Demo (8 min)

**[Switch to live Claude Desktop]**

Demo 1: Check wallet balance
```
> Check my x402 balance
💰 $50.00 USDs | 📈 +$0.02 yield today
```

Demo 2: Make a paid request
```
> Get premium satellite weather for San Francisco

🔍 Found PremiumWeather API ($0.05)
💳 Paying...
✅ Payment confirmed!
[Shows detailed forecast]
```

Demo 3: Show the transaction on block explorer

Demo 4: Check updated balance
```
💰 $49.95 USDs
```

"That was a real transaction. Real money. Real data. Zero human intervention."

### 5. Architecture Deep Dive (5 min)

**Slide: "How It Works"**

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ AI Client   │────▶│ MCP Server  │────▶│ Blockchain  │
│ (Claude)    │     │ (x402)      │     │ (Arbitrum)  │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘

       │ Natural Language  │ EIP-712 Signatures
       │ Tool Calls        │ ERC-3009 Transfers
```

**Slide: "The x402 Tool"**

```typescript
const x402_pay_request = async (params: {
  url: string;
  maxPayment: string;
}) => {
  // 1. Make initial request
  // 2. If 402, parse payment details
  // 3. Sign payment
  // 4. Retry with payment proof
  // 5. Return data
};
```

**Slide: "Server-Side (5 lines)"**

```typescript
app.use(paymentMiddleware({
  "GET /api/data": {
    price: "0.05",
    network: "arbitrum"
  }
}));
```

### 6. The Emerging AI Economy (4 min)

**Slide: "AI-to-AI Commerce"**

- Research Agent pays Data Agent for cleaning
- Writing Agent pays Verification Agent for fact-checking
- Coding Agent pays Security Agent for audits

**Slide: "The Tool Marketplace"**

- Developers publish tools with x402 pricing
- Agents discover via registry
- Agents pay, use, and rate tools
- Developers earn money

"We're building the infrastructure for AI-to-AI commerce."

**Slide: "Yield-Bearing Wallets"**

- USDs earns ~5% APY automatically
- AI wallets grow when idle
- Creates genuine economic incentives

### 7. Safety & Guardrails (3 min)

**Slide: "The Obvious Question"**

"Isn't giving AI money terrifying?"

**Slide: "Yes. Here's How We Handle It."**

1. **Spending limits**: $1/tx, $10/day default
2. **Whitelisting**: Only pre-approved addresses
3. **Human confirmation**: Above threshold
4. **Full logging**: Every tx with purpose
5. **Testnet first**: Fake money until confident

"Give AI just enough economic agency to be useful, with clear boundaries."
