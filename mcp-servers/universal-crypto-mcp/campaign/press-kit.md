## The Story

### The Problem
AI assistants can write code, analyze data, and perform valuable work—but they can't buy a $0.05 API call. Every paid service requires human configuration, creating a bottleneck in AI automation.

### The Solution
Universal Crypto MCP implements x402, a protocol that finally gives HTTP 402 "Payment Required" a purpose. When an AI agent encounters a paywall, it can now automatically:
1. Read the payment requirements
2. Sign a transaction from its wallet
3. Complete the payment
4. Access the service

### The Impact
This enables:
- **Autonomous AI agents** that can access premium services without human intervention
- **AI-to-AI marketplaces** where agents trade services with each other
- **Yield-generating wallets** where AI funds grow ~5% APY when idle
- **Micropayments** as small as $0.001 for fine-grained API access
