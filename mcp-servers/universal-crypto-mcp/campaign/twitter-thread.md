## THE THREAD

### Tweet 1/10 (Hook)

```
We just gave Claude a crypto wallet 🧵

Now it can:
• 💳 Pay for premium APIs automatically
• 💰 Hold its own funds
• 📈 Earn 5% yield while waiting
• ⛓️ Work across 20+ blockchains

The future of AI agents is here.
```

**[Attach: Demo GIF showing Claude making a paid request]**

### Tweet 2/10 (The Problem)

```
The problem with AI today:

Claude can write code worth $10,000
Claude can analyze data that saves hours
Claude can plan complex projects

But Claude can't buy you a $0.05 API call.

Until now.
```

### Tweet 3/10 (x402 Explanation)

```
Introducing x402 - the payment protocol for AI agents.

Remember HTTP 402 "Payment Required"?
It's been reserved since 1999.

We finally gave it a purpose.

When Claude hits a paywall:
1. Server returns 402 + payment details
2. Claude pays from its wallet
3. Server grants access
4. You get the data

Zero human intervention.
```

### Tweet 4/10 (The Tech)

```
The tech stack:

• MCP (Model Context Protocol) for AI integration
• x402 protocol for HTTP payments
• USDs stablecoin (earns ~5% APY!)
• Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum + 17 more chains
• 380+ tools included

One npm package. One config file.
```

### Tweet 5/10 (Demo)

```
Watch Claude pay for a premium weather API:

User: "Get satellite weather for Tokyo"

Claude: 
🔍 Found PremiumWeather API ($0.05)
💳 Paying from x402 wallet...
✅ Payment confirmed!

[Returns detailed satellite forecast]

Balance: $49.95 (was $50.00)

Magic. ✨
```

### Tweet 6/10 (Use Cases)

```
What can AI do with money?

💸 Pay for premium APIs
📊 Access paywalled research
🤖 Trade with other AI agents
💱 Execute DeFi operations
🎁 Tip content creators
🛒 Buy digital goods

We're building the infrastructure for AI economics.
```

---

### Tweet 7/10 (Safety)

```
"But isn't giving AI money dangerous?"

We thought about that:

• ✅ Configurable spending limits (default: $1 max)
• ✅ Address whitelisting
• ✅ Testnet mode
• ✅ Full transaction logging
• ✅ Human-readable confirmations

You set the guardrails. AI operates within them.
```

## BONUS TWEETS (Reply to thread)

### Bonus 1 - Technical Deep Dive

```
🔧 For the curious - how x402 works under the hood:

1. Client makes HTTP request
2. Server returns 402 + JSON with payment options
3. Client signs EIP-712 message
4. Payment settles on-chain (Arbitrum = cheap!)
5. Server verifies, grants access

All in <2 seconds.
```

### Bonus 2 - Yield Explanation

```
Why USDs?

@SperaxUSD is a stablecoin that earns yield automatically.

Your AI's wallet earns ~5% APY while it waits.
No staking. No claiming. Just holding.

So when Claude isn't spending, it's earning.
```

### Bonus 3 - Comparison

```
Why we built this:

| Feature | x402 | Traditional |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Account needed | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Human approval | ❌ No | ✅ Every time |
| Min payment | $0.001 | $0.50+ |
| Speed | Seconds | Days |
| Cross-border | ✅ Free | 💸 Expensive |
