## Why W3AG?

Web3 introduces unique accessibility barriers that traditional [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) don't address:

- **42-character hex addresses** are unreadable by screen readers and impossible to verify for users with cognitive disabilities
- **Transaction signing flows** present critical security information in ways that exclude users with visual or cognitive impairments
- **Time-sensitive operations** (auctions, liquidations, MEV) discriminate against users who need more processing time
- **Seed phrase management** creates barriers for users with motor impairments or memory difficulties
- **Gas and fee estimation** interfaces assume visual parsing of complex, dynamic information

Over 1 billion people globally live with disabilities. Web3 should be for everyone.

## Specification Structure

W3AG follows the W3C's proven accessibility framework:

```
Principles (4)
  └── Guidelines (16)
        └── Success Criteria (50+)
              └── Techniques & Patterns
```

### Conformance Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Level A** | Minimum accessibility. Removes the most severe barriers. |
| **Level AA** | Recommended baseline. Addresses significant barriers. |
| **Level AAA** | Enhanced accessibility. Optimal experience for all users. |

---

## The Four Principles

### 1. Perceivable
Blockchain information and UI components must be presentable in ways all users can perceive.

### 2. Operable  
Wallet connections, transaction signing, and DeFi interactions must be operable by all users.

### 3. Understandable
Transaction details, risks, and outcomes must be understandable to users with cognitive disabilities.

### 4. Robust
Web3 applications must work reliably with assistive technologies and alternative input methods.

## Techniques & Patterns

### Address Display Patterns

```tsx
// ❌ Inaccessible
<span>0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f...</span>

// ✅ Accessible
<AddressDisplay
  address="0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f"
  ensName="vitalik.eth"
  ariaLabel="Address: vitalik.eth (0x742d...5f)"
  showCopyButton
  copyAnnouncement="Address copied to clipboard"
/>
```

### Transaction Confirmation Pattern

```tsx
// ✅ Accessible transaction summary
<TransactionSummary
  type="swap"
  aria-live="polite"
>
  <h2>Confirm Swap</h2>
  <p>You are swapping 1.5 ETH for approximately 2,847 USDC.</p>
  <p>Maximum slippage: 0.5% (14.23 USDC)</p>
  <p>Network fee: approximately $3.42</p>
  
  <WarningBanner level="info">
    Price may change between now and confirmation.
  </WarningBanner>
  
  <ButtonGroup>
    <Button onClick={reject} aria-label="Cancel swap">
      Cancel
    </Button>
    <Button onClick={confirm} aria-label="Confirm swap of 1.5 ETH for USDC">
      Confirm Swap
    </Button>
  </ButtonGroup>
</TransactionSummary>
```

### Time Extension Pattern

```tsx
// ✅ Accessible time-sensitive operation
<AuctionBid
  endsIn={timeRemaining}
  onTimeWarning={() => announce("Auction ending in 30 seconds")}
  extendable={true}
  onRequestExtension={handleExtension}
  extensionLabel="Need more time? Request 60-second extension"
/>
```
